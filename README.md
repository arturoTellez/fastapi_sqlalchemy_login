# FastAPI with SQLAlchemy Login System

This project demonstrates a basic FastAPI application integrated with SQLAlchemy to create a simple login system. SQLite is used as the backend database for this demonstration.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users based on their credentials.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/fastapi_sqlalchemy_login.git
    cd fastapi_sqlalchemy_login
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Initialize the Database**:
    ```bash
    python init_db.py
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

The application will be running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). For API documentation, visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

## API Endpoints

- **Create a New User**:
    - **URL**: `/users/`
    - **Method**: `POST`
    - **Payload**: 
        ```json
        {
            "username": "your_username",
            "password": "your_password"
        }
        ```

- **Login**:
    - **URL**: `/login/`
    - **Method**: `POST`
    - **Payload**: 
        ```json
        {
            "username": "your_username",
            "password": "your_password"
        }
        ```

## Future Improvements

- Add password hashing for security.
- Implement JWT for user authentication and authorization.
- Extend the user model to include more attributes like email, full name, etc.
- Implement user profile and update features.
